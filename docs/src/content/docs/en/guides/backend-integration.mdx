React PDF Level Up is not just for the frontend. You can use the `generatePDF` function in Node.js environments to programmatically generate documents, save them to disk, or send them as an HTTP response.

## Requirements

Make sure your environment supports React. This generally works out-of-the-box in frameworks like **Next.js**, **Remix**, **express**, **fastify**, or in simple Node, bun scripts, or any environment that supports ES Modules.

## Script Example

The following example shows how to generate a PDF, convert it to a Buffer, and save it to the file system or send it to the frontend.

```typescript
import { generatePDF } from "@react-pdf-levelup/core";
import Template from "./MyTemplate"; // Your Template component

const controllerX = async () => {
    try {
        const data = {
            name: "Juan Pérez",
            age: 30,
            city: "Madrid",
        };

        // 1. Generate the PDF in base64
        const base64PDF = await generatePDF({ template: Template, data });

        if (!base64PDF) {
            throw new Error("Could not generate PDF");
        }

        return base64PDF;

    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error generating PDF:", error);
    }
};

```

## Usage in API Endpoints (from your backend).

If you are using Express, Next.js API Routes, or another HTTP server, you can send the buffer directly to the client and decode it on the frontend.

## I do not use a JavaScript/TypeScript execution environment.

Can I use React PDF Level Up? Yes, you can use the REST API designed to generate PDFs. You can find the documentation for this API at [this link](https://react-pdf-levelup.nimbux.cloud/docs/en/guides/api-rest/)
